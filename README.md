# FlutterFire Samples

**Firebase** with **Flutter**. The final goal is to create something like the [Flutter Gallery](https://github.com/flutter/gallery) app, but for Firebase.

Also, the recently changes introduced in **Flutter 2** create some confusion, mostly with the beginners, as many other repositories are not yet updated to the latest version. Even [FlutterFire](https://firebase.flutter.dev/) plugins got a lot of improvements and most of them support null safety now.

> **NOTE:** This entire repo uses the latest **Flutter 2.0 stable** release, with **null safety** enabled, for creating the sample apps.

If you like the content of this repository, please don't forget to :star: this.

> :construction: . :red_circle: . The `master` branch is currently **WIP** for adding all types of Firebase samples in this repo. If you want to try out any sample checkout the following branches:

Currently the repo contains:

* [Firebase Authentication (email & password)](https://github.com/sbis04/flutterfire-samples/tree/email-password)
* [Firebase Authentication (using Google Sign-In)](https://github.com/sbis04/flutterfire-samples/tree/google-sign-in)
* [Cloud Firestore database (CRUD operations)](https://github.com/sbis04/flutterfire-samples/tree/crud-firestore)

The `master` branch is currently having the implementation for Firebase Authentication (using Google Sign-In), but it will soon be updated.

For this project you have to add two plugins:

- [firebase_core](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_core): Required for initializing Firebase and using any other Firebase plugins.

The latest version of both these plugins support *null safety*.
